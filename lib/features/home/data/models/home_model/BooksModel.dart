Understanding them doesn't really mean only being able to use them. A lot of people can use them without understanding them.\" Christopher Strachey The development of programming languages is one of the finest intellectual achievements of the new discipline called Computer Science. And yet, there is no other subject that I know of, that has such emotionalism and mystique associated with it. Thus my attempt to write about this highly charged subject is taken with a good deal of caution. Nevertheless, in my role as Professor I have felt the need for a modern treatment of this subject. Traditional books on programming languages are like abbreviated language manuals, but this book takes a fundamentally different point of view. I believe that the best possible way to study and understand today's programming languages is by focusing on a few essential concepts. These concepts form the outline for this book and include such topics as variables, expressions, statements, typing, scope, procedures, data types, exception handling and concurrency. By understanding what these concepts are and how they are realized in different programming languages, one arrives at a level of comprehension far greater than one gets by writing some programs in a vi vB Preface few languages. Moreover, knowledge of these concepts provides a framework for understanding future language designs.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783642967290"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3642967299"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":450,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XUqqCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XUqqCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=XUqqCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject+:+programming&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XUqqCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XUqqCAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":2973.85,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"retailPrice":{"amount":2973.85,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XUqqCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-XUqqCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":2973850000,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":2973850000,"currencyCode":"EGP"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books/download/Fundamentals_of_Programming_Languages-sample-pdf.acsm?id=XUqqCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XUqqCAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Traditional books on programming languages are like abbreviated language manuals, but this book takes a fundamentally different point of view."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"FZ-eDwAAQBAJ","etag":"0pf/6jvaXcc","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FZ-eDwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Must Know High School Computer Programming","authors":["Julie Sway"],"publisher":"McGraw Hill Professional","publishedDate":"2019-12-27","description":"The new Must Know series is like a lightning bolt to the brain Every school subject has must know ideas, or essential concepts, that lie behind it.

Object-oriented programming is nothing new-it first arose in the sixties. The motivation came from the simulation of discrete event systems. The concept first manifested itself in the language Simula 67. It took nearly two decades for the method to gain impetus, and today object-oriented programming is an important concept and a powerful technique. Meanwhile, we can even speak of an over reaction, for the concept has become a buzzword. But buzzwords always appear where there is the hope of exploiting ill-informed clients because they see the new approach as the solution to all their problems. Thus object-oriented programming is often hailed as a panacea. And so the question is justified: What is really behind it? To let the cat out of the bag: There is more to object-oriented programming than merely putting data as objects in the fore ground, instead of algorithms to which the data are subject. It is more than purely an alternative view of programmed systems. To identify the essence of object-oriented programming, is the subject of this book. This is a textbook that shows in a didactically skillful way which concepts and constructs are new, where they can be employed reasonably, and what advantages they offer. For, not all programs are automatically improved by merely recasting them in an object-oriented style.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783642974793"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3642974791"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":278,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LdSoCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LdSoCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=LdSoCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject+:+programming&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LdSoCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LdSoCAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":2973.85,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"retailPrice":{"amount":2973.85,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LdSoCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-LdSoCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":2973850000,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":2973850000,"currencyCode":"EGP"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books/download/Object_Oriented_Programming-sample-pdf.acsm?id=LdSoCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=LdSoCAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"It is more than purely an alternative view of programmed systems.
